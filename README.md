# Linux SSL Proxy Manager
A tool to easily setup SSL for localhost development on Linux.

## Features
- Automatic self-signed SSL certificate generation
- Browser trust configuration
- Nginx proxy configuration
- Domain mapping in /etc/hosts
- Simple CLI interface

## Installation

1.  Download the script:

```bash
sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/ssl-proxy-manager https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rishabkumar7/linux-ssl-proxy-manager/main/ssl-proxy-manager.sh
```

2.  Make it executable:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ssl-proxy-manager
```

3.  Install dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y nginx openssl libnss3-tools
```

## Usage

**Add a new domain:**

```bash
sudo ssl-proxy-manager add my.custom.local localhost 3000
```

**Remove a domain:**

```bash
sudo ssl-proxy-manager remove my.custom.local
```

**List all configured domains:**

```bash
sudo ssl-proxy-manager list
```

## How It Works

1.  **Certificate Generation**: Creates self-signed SSL certificates for your custom domains
2.  **Browser Trust**: Configures Firefox, Chrome/Chromium, and system-wide certificate stores to trust your certificates
3.  **Nginx Configuration**: Sets up Nginx as a reverse proxy with proper SSL configuration
4.  **Hosts File**: Updates /etc/hosts to map your custom domains to 127.0.0.1

## Troubleshooting

-   **Certificate not trusted**: Try restarting your browser after adding a new domain
-   **Cannot access the domain**: Make sure Nginx is running (`sudo systemctl status nginx`)
-   **Permission denied errors**: The script must be run with sudo privileges

## Security Note
The certificates generated by this tool are self-signed and only intended for local development. They are not suitable for production environments.
